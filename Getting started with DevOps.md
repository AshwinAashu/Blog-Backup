Modern applications are different from the 'old school' applications. Today software releases are taking place at a higher pace. These applications are not just a passive board for users to get required information from but it is rather actively engaging with users to understand and cater to their needs. Competitiveness is the driving force here. This post will attempt to provide a brief introduction to the DevOps culture. 

DevOps brings two words together -  'Development' and 'Operations'. Essentially, it aims at reducing the communication gaps and overhead wastage to make better applications at faster velocity.  DevOps is a set of cultural practices and tools which enables an organization to deliver applications at a higher pace than traditional software development process. It enables organizations in these five areas :

1. To deliver features / applications at a much faster pace.  
2. Quick response to user feedbacks leading to enhanced customer satisfaction.
3. Improved capacity to innovate and automate what can and should be automated.  
4. Improved collaboration with the teams 
5. Better security, compliance and reliability

DevOps uses lean principles to reduce wastes. This allows room to focus on activities that provide more value. To do this, DevOps involves a certain set of practices and philosophies that can be summarized as :

1. Developing and continuously testing in a production like environment.
2. Deploying repeatable processes 
3. Continuous monitoring and validation 
4. Creating feedback system and iterating the process for improvement. 

I feel that DevOps logo does a decent job at explaining the steps involved.

DevOps process starts at the planning stage. This is where we identify the value we are intending to provide to our customers. We analyze the idea and get an understanding of our feature / application and also provide space for feedbacks that can help us improve our product.

Second comes the code which is responsible for Collaborative development. Collaborative development refers to providing a common set of practices and platform to teams so as to bridge the communication and infrastructural gaps. It also involves continuous integrations where team members frequently integrate their work with that of the rest of the team. Tools such as version control systems helps developers collaborate and integrate their work. 

Build and testing involves steps such as compilation, validation, code reviews and various tests. The idea is to perform frequent tests, ensure best practices and validate the quality of the product.

Release and deploy stages help affirm the quality of the product and then using the delivery pipeline, ensure continuous deployment to quality assurance and then to production. 

Operate and Monitor allows organizations to understand how the product has performed in production and engage their customers for direct feedbacks. This helps businesses take prudent decisions based on tangible metrices collected by continuous monitoring of the product at each stage. 

Based on the outcomes of the operate and monitoring stages, the process then iterates and goes back to planning based on those feedbacks.
